Overview
========

Just a small site building in Jekyll for my github IO presence. This is generally meant as a brochure site for me professionally.

Vagrant
-------

I prefer to run the build in vagrant so I don't have to install any dependencies on my local machine. The provisioning should work from a windows machine as well since it uses vagrant shell provisioning.

Jekyll theme adopted from the very find [agency-jekyll-theme](https://github.com/y7kim/agency-jekyll-theme) by the very smart [Rick K](https://github.com/y7kim)
