description: This was an internal project I coded after becoming the Head of Software Engineering at Emory Libraries.  I established an effective Agile Development methodology with the team, but we lacked a meaningful agile portfolio management tool.  I created dWrangler in Python using Django to do just that, and it became a cornerstone for software planning for the entire organization.
