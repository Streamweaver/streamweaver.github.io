description: This was an internal project I coded after becoming the Head of Software Engineering at Emory Libraries.  I established an effective Agile development methodology with the team in the months before but we lacked any sort of meaingful agile portfolio management tool.  So I created dWranger in python using Django to do just that and it became a cornerstone for software planning for the entire organization.
