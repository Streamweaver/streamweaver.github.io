description: The Rushdie Archives was a project my team developed with grant funding for the Emory University Special Collections Library.  It featured a first of its kind emulated environment recovered through digital forensics and preserved through our digital archive.  I primarily provided project planning, consulted on the design and worked to help develop a project plan for the Software Engineers on my team.
