description: The Occupy Wall Street Twitter Harvest began in haste to capture as much of the social media record as we could about the emerging OWS movement in realtime.  My role was as a Software Engineer. I rapidly (in a single night) <a href="https://github.com/emory-libraries/Twap">coded a persistent harvester</a>  to capture tweets occurring during that period for analysis by scholars later.
